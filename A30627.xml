            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Rom. 16.18. <hi>For they that be ſuch, ſerve not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by good words, and fair ſpeeches, deceives the hearts of the

            <p>Miſtake me not <hi>(My Brethren)</hi> as if I intended to juſtifie you, either in your arrogated zeal and ſanctity, or in your bold charges of tepidity, and luke-warmneſs againſt our former Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.

Much more ſhould you have held your hands, when ſome of your Conſciences could not but bear you witneſs, that you accuſed many, if not moſt of them falſely; for had all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops been remiſs, or luke-warm, you could have had neither occaſion, nor pretence to cry out ſo pitiouſly of perſecution un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them.

Who reads them ſhall find our Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in making whips of great Cords, to drive unclean perſons out of the Temple. But becauſe the books are not in all mens hands, I will ttanſcribe a paſſage out of the latter, worthy of golden characters, and everlaſting memory; It runs thus. <hi>This preſent Synod ſtraitly chargeth all Clergy men in this Church,</hi>

And that according to the power with which they are intruſted, they diligently labour, by the execution of the above named Canons, and all other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical proviſions made for this end, to reform all offenſive, and ſcandalous perſons (if any be) in the Miniſtery. as they tender the welfare and proſpering of piety, and religion, and as they will anſwer to God, for thoſe ſcandals which through their remiſneſs, or neglect ſhall ariſe, or grow, in this Church of Chriſt.</hi> Thus for the Canon,</p>

            <p>That the people were prophane, is to be bewailed, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided as the fault of a Diſcipline. They were ſo, both in Chriſts, and the Apoſtles times, and under their Government, neither was due proviſion wanting in our time, to reſtrain it, as in theirs, though ſucceſeleſly in both. Do not therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon weak, and crazed Judgments, that for a cauſe, which is none, and ſuppoſe the worſt, even that too much indulgency was uſed towards thoſe offenders, yet conſider frail humanity, wherein thy ſelf bears a ſhare, call to mind the diſtraction, which fear of widening a Schiſme, might raiſe, even in the moſt ſober ſpirits, thou wilt find the very reaſon, why the power to revenge diſobediennce, and prophaneſs, was not more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly put forth, and executed; Did'ſt thou, or the men of

            <p>There are two more grand exceptions (not for any weight in themſelves, but for their prevalency upon ſome mens capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) againſt Epiſcopacy, the former is drawn from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the latter from the Lordly titles of the Biſhops. Reader lend me a little patience, while I anſwer both in order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Firſt, we are bound by a Covenant, as well to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate Praelatical Epiſcopacy, as Popery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> I know this Covenant pretends both, unto the Word of God, and the Laws of the land, for its preſident and warrant, but it cites no parallel caſe,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>I begin with the matter of the Covenant; Expect not (Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that I ſhould load my Pen, or thy patience, with the whole bulk of its<note n="a" place="margin">Beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, liberties of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, higheſt Judicatories, nigheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and uniformity.</note>

               <hi>Injurious</hi> expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the two latter misbecoming reformed Chriſtians of an Evangelical Spirit, and the former moſt neceſſary to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in all Oaths, which exact, or expect performance. All of them vaſtly different from the Scripture qualifications of a Covenant. Jer. 4.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear the Lord liveth, in truth, in righteouſneſs, and in Judgment.</hi> My intent is to keep cloſe, and ſolely, to the matter of Epiſcopacy, covenanted againſt. The word <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> is of a doubtful ſignification, our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters found it to be ſo, when to preſerve their Government,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97860:6"/> and miniſterial order, from extruſion by the Covenant, they were neceſſitated to diſtinguiſh betwixt Scripture Epiſcopacy, and Biſhops, and Engliſh Epiſcopacy, and Biſhops. But this Cobweb diſtinction doth not mend the matter of their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, every one ſees Paſſion, Self, and Faction in it, and will believe it, till the Covenanters ſhall ſoberly, and convincingly prove Engliſh Epiſcopacy, or our Churches retention of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, diſtinct from, and ſuperiour unto Presbyters, to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural; the contrary is endeavoured to be evidenced by the following Treatiſe. And if I have ſucceſſefully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed it, diſingaged men will ſoon reſolve, that the matter of any Covenant approved by God in Scripture cannot be Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to this national Covenant, which forſwears an order of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution. And if this Covenant do oblige Chriſts office of Legiſlator, or high Prieſt, is vainly confirmed to him by his fathers oath. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.21. when mens ſubſequent oaths, may diſanul the Government, and reject his inſtituted orders of Miniſters in his Church. This ſingle confidence of oppoſing, and the thruſting forth of the Church, an order divinely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, is ſufficient, not only to demonſtrate the corrupt materials of a Covenant, and the incapacity of any perſons whatſoever, to compoſe or impoſe it, but alſo to denominate it (with what ever titles byaſſed men apparel it) a league with hell, and death, not a Covenant with the Lord. An engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not fitted to procure Chriſt an unity, but to nouriſh and foment Diabolical diviſions. Neither let any imagine that theſe terms drop only from the pens of enemies, to the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſtical model; for learned <hi>Zanchy,</hi> (as <hi>Dr. Ferne,</hi>

But we will proceed unto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſort of perſons Covenanting, who are</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Perſons</hi> efficient. The firſt Movers of our Covenant were</p>
            <p>Firſt, The ſubordinate Magiſtrates and Miniſters, both of them unqualified to make the Covenant, not onely becauſe they were ſeparate from the chief Magiſtrate, but becauſe they were in Covenant before, and bound as faſt as Religion and Law could tye them. All of them by the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and ſome of them with the ſuperadded Oath of Canonical obedience. All which Oath's, as they were taken in the name, and preſence of the moſt high God, ſo they were prior and precedent to the Covenant. Now to evince the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of ſuch perſons, to make a Covenant contrary to their former Covenant, muſt with all prove it lawful, and in the power of a Chriſtian to free himſelf of the obligation of one Oath by ſwearing another, that he will not keep it.

Whence we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that though the illuſtration ſpeak of tyranical civil rule, yet the propoſition illuſtrated relates unto Chriſts condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spiritual tyranny or rancour, and ſenſoriouſneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſome Apoſtles towards others.

It being well known that many of Chriſts exhortations unto, and reproofs of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, concern all Chriſtians, as repreſented in them: Allow the former, it is miſalledged to disprove the preſent Titles of Church-officers; it being a particular caſe, and not to be drawn into preſident to the prejudice of any perſons, whom it doth not nominate.

            <p>Secondly, In a Civil and Political, In which reſpect, unleſs we will introduce Papal exemption, or quaking Anarchy; Church-officers muſt do thoſe duties, and diſcharge thoſe truſts which the Laws, or cuſtoms of the Nations wherein they live, expect, and require from perſons of their Eſtates, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, or Qualities. That Chriſtian Biſhops may where the eſtate is Chriſtian lawfully concern themſelves in Civil matters; and have done it many hundred years ago, by, and under the authority of the Supreme Magiſtrate, without any enter-fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Spiritual offices, is at truth ſo fully a teſted by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97860:10"/> all ſorts of teſtimony, as <hi>the Scriptures, the Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf: all quoted by <hi>Biſhop Davenant</hi> in his eleventh <hi>queſtion of his Theological determinations,</hi> as more need not to be added. That this doth not thwart St. <hi>Pauls</hi> injunctions <hi>againſt being intangled with the affairs of this life.</hi> 2. Tim. 2.3. may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidenced. This text is ſometime urged upon all men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing them to forſake the world, and turn <hi>Monks and Hermits,</hi> ſo by many blind Zealots in the Papacy; Other times it is ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt ſome men, or Biſhops, commanding them ot relinquiſh their Revenues and Jurisdiction, thus by many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous Presbyters. The former notion is more ingenious, and carries leſs partiality with it then the latter, that inviting all men to a voluntary beggery, and levelling community, this extorting honours and eſtates from ſome men, therewith to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn and inrich their ambitions, or malevolous enemies.</p>
            <p>But neither of them are true; for had a total abdication of the affairs of this life, been negatively, and at all times, and in all caſes enjoyned unto all men, we ſhould not ſo often meet with the diſtinctions betwixt <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>rich, bond and free, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and maſters, ſuhjects and Kings</hi> inſerted in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor was it a particular command to Church-officers, ſince St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpends not a ſmall part of the Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to ſhew him how <hi>oeconomically</hi> a Biſhop ought to govern his own houſe; and how <hi>Politically</hi> he ought to proceed in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and infliction of Church-cenſures. See 1. <hi>Tim. cap.</hi> 3. and <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Beza</hi> eying the deſign of Monkery, who principally urge the text in vindication of their ſingle life, tells them, and experience confirms, that a Soldier (the metaphor of whoſe calling the Apoſtle follows in this text) is not abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from marriage, many of them marching with their wives in company. But marriage draws along with it, if not all, yet the greateſt and ſoreſt affairs of this life. 1 Cor. 7.33. <hi>But he that is married careth for the things of this world how he may</hi> pleaſe his wife. The truth therefore is, Civil Affairs are no more interdicted to a Biſhop then to a Soldier, to neither of them indefinitely, and abſolutely, to both of them caſually, and upon ſpeciall occaſions, ſo far forth as they are inconſiſtent with their callings, and avert them from their duties, and no otherwiſe, or longer. This will be greedily devoured by ſome, who will forthwith ſay, we grant all required by Antagoniſts. May they therefore digeſt our meaning, which is, that by things inconent with a calling, and avertent
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97860:10"/> from duty, we underſtand all, and only ſuch things as are ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and abſolutely of that nature, ſuch things as at no time, in no capacity can be, a duty incumbent upon the perſon concerned. A Soldier hath ſeveral duties (to omit all others) as a Soldier, as Victualling, Training, Scouting, Reſting, Charging, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating, Fighting, to enjoyn him fighting where any of the reſt is, his duty, and to ſay he were no Soldier, what ever elſe his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary occaſions were, becauſe he is not alwaies actually ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in fighting with his enemies is ſuch an abſurdity as cannot impoſe upon any men, who have not made total ſhipwrack of their underſtandings. Church-officers are Men, Subjects, Chriſtians, as well as Church-officers. In all theſe reſpects they have ſeveral and diſtinct duties, and they (as other men) have their circumſcribed and ſtrict limits, they can be in no more places, or ingaged upon any more actions then one at one time; therefore to urge the performance of all thoſe duties upon them at once, and to affirm they totally renounce one duty when they diſcharge another, is to charge St. <hi>Paul</hi> with deſerting Goſpel-preaching, when he ſhut the opened door upon himſelf at <hi>Troas,</hi> and went thence to compoſe the ſchiſm at <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2 Cor. 2.12, 13. <hi>Furthermore when I came to Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing betwixt theſe two ſeveral capacities in Church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, hath nurſt the cavil againſt our Biſhops titles; not that they were never ſeparated until now, for they are diſtinct in their natures, nor that the Biſhops were not careful to maintain them diſtinct in their adminiſtrations; for when did any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop derive, or challenge his power to preach, ordain, confirm or cenſure eccleſiaſtically as a Lord of Parliament, or when did he derive his Civil honours from the Epiſcopal Inſtitution. His relation to the Church and conſecration by former Biſhops, made him a Biſhop, but his Princes favour, and his intereſt in the Kingdom made him (as every other) Lord. Neither ought he to be ſent to his Bible, to prove his Title, which he (as all of like dignity) holdeth by his Princes munificence, and the Law of the Land. Beſides as Lord Biſhop, de hath not more power in the Church, nor would he have leſs then if he were not a Lord, becauſe he holds his Biſhoprick, and his Lordſhip by a different tenure, the one under King Chriſt, the other under his lawful Sovereign. He may be as others are a Lord, and not a Biſhop, and he may be a Biſhop and not a Lord, only a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop he muſt be, if he lawfully do Epiſcopal works: A Lord he may be, if his Prince allow him that Title. Furthermore, let it be well obſerved, this diſtinction is not only fitted to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the honour of Biſhops, but 'tis neceſſary to be continued for the indemnifying of the Civil Intereſt of the meaneſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; for otherwiſe if any Honours, Manours, or Lands de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to a Miniſter after he hath received holy orders (as who can with any modeſty deny that many Miniſters ſprout from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, or worſhipful ſtocks) he ought not to own them, but ſuffer them to fall into the Kings hands, or Eſcheat into the Lord Paramount, or come to the next heir, leſt by reaſon of thoſe Honours, Mannors, or Lands, he rranſgreſs the rule of Chriſt in the objection, by becomming a Baron, Lord, or Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, and ſo exerciſe Jurisdiction and authority over his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects, Suiters, or Tenants. And finally; the <hi>London Presbyters</hi> when they found their ordination by Lord Biſhops

And give it the world under their hands, that <hi>The Lordly titles of the Biſhops were meer civil additaments annexed to their Biſhopricks by Kingly favour, not eſſential ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to their office.</hi> Thus they.

What way is there to compoſe the difference? but either with the <hi>Socinian</hi> to cut the knot and deny all divine right, or fairly to unty it; by declaring whoſe the Divine right is; both of you cannot have it, neceſſary therefore it is to ſettle it with one; leaſt while we fight, &amp; deſtroy one another for the ſhadow, we looſe the ſubſtance. Our late hazard whereof, I hope you have both ſeen &amp; lamented.

            <p>Aboue four year ſince, having not long before received Presbyterial Impoſition of hands; Providence caſt me into the company of one of the chief of that Presbytery, we being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, he and I only in company, he delivered me an open book into my hand, with a leaf turned down, againſt the argument for the imparity of Miniſters, drawn from the divers inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>twelve Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>ſeventy Diſciples,</hi> which he willed me to read, conſider, and give him my thoughts upon it, I did all but the latter, which ſtrook me into horror and amazement; I could as eaſily have given him an Empire, as my preſent thoughts upon it, for neither of them were in my power; but God made a way for me to eſcape the tentation, other bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren coming in to viſit him in the mean time, diverted us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other diſcourſes; neither did he again require it at any time afterwards. Who was the author of this book I know not, it was a ſmall imperfect piece in 16. without either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or ending; which I only ſaw at that time, for one quarter of an hour, and never afterwards. But though I was free of him, I could not ſo rid my thoughts of it; many were the reaſonings, and ſearchings of my Spirit why it was propoſed unto me, and what uſe I was to make of it, now it was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Sometimes I feared it was offered to try my reſolution, or irreſolution in my late engagement, but I ſoon overſtrid this block, not finding any cauſe for its laying before me, either in my intentions or actions, becauſe what I had done hitherto was in the ſimplicity of my heart, and I alwaies went with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt in obedience to the commands of that Society.

Would men of greateſt graces conſider how many Talents are forgiven them, they would never rigourouſly exact pence from their delinquent brother, who profeſſeth penitence. St. <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſſions to the high flown Corinthian Church, is worthily remarkable. 1 Cor. 5.9, 10, 11. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with mankind, nor theeves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners ſhall inherit the kingdom of God?

And I could ſay more, but theſe Fig-leaves are too dry and rotten to cover a ſinful nakedneſs, they have ſinned, and I have ſinned, our ſins do not extenuate one anothers, the Lord grant us all repentance unto life. <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs, and let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excellent oyl, which ſhall not break my head, for yet my prayer ſhall be in their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.</hi> Let Gods ordinances be precious, I cannot be too vile, for I ſeek not my own honour, but theirs.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given a faithful, and free account of my motives and ends in this great undertaking. All which I commend <hi>(Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter)</hi> to thy ſerious peruſal, and conſideration; look off the

            <p>THou haſt read a large Epiſtle, dedicated to another ſort of men, and maiſt perhaps queſtion why I ſtumble at the threſhold, and neglect to ſalute thee. Wilt thou know the reaſon? 'Tis neither out of careleſneſs, nor incivility, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly, and of ſet purpoſe, becauſe this whole Book is a kind of Preface, unto a following diſcourſe, unto which thou ſhalt find herein a frequent reference, namely the tract concerning A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
            <p>What is writ, read freely. <hi>I</hi> will not foreſtal thy judgment, by telling thee ſeveral, learned, godly, and judicious perſons have encouraged me in this deſigne, though <hi>I</hi> could do it truly, and name time, place, perſons and expreſſions. Thou art at thy liberty; carry thy cenſure along with thy judgment, <hi>I</hi> am not ſo in love with error, as to make my ſelf a party, when thou impleadeſt it.</p>

Where others ſtand with me, obſerve who they are, of what perſwaſion they are, and whether <hi>I</hi> had not reaſon to alledge them, in confutation, or confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, if not of ſomewhat mentioned in this Tract, yet of ſome other thing, which thy reaſon may induce thee to beleeve, may be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more fully handled.</p>

               <hi>Zanchius</hi> thus. <hi>Evangeliſts are ſo denominated from writing, or preaching the Goſpel; their name is new, and reſerved to new Teſtament times. What they were I ſhall briefly teach others, as I have learned out of holy Writ. They were in my opinion, either ſuch as the Apoſtles took with them, by the Revelation of Chriſt, or ſent forth with Apoſtolical Authority to preach the Goſpel, now here, now there, where the Apoſtles had not founded Churches. Or they were Goſpel-writers. According to the former ſenſe, the Apoſtle writing to Timothy,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>ſaith, do the work of an Evangeliſt, that is, preach the Goſpel, for Timothy was before ordained biſhop by St. Paul; In this ſenſe alſo, is Philip the Deacon an Evangeliſt,</hi> Act. 21. <hi>In the latter ſenſe, Mark and Luke were properly Evangeliſts; Matthew, and John, both Apoſtles and Evangeliſts. To ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, this officer doth not now continue in the Church, for although many endued with ſpecial grace, do preach the Goſpel, or defend its doctrine by their writings, yet they do it not by authority immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly derived from the Apoſtles, as Mark, Luke, Timothy, Titus and others, or from Chriſt himſelf, as Matthew, and John, but by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority derived from the Magiſtrates, or Churches.</hi>

Beſides Sathan, and ſeducers, could never want a gap, through which they would bring dreadful, and endleſs confuſions into Chriſtian ſocieties; for could looſe profeſſors once compaſs this point, that Scripture hurls together matters of Faith, and order ſo confuſedly, as what is firſt, what ſecond, could not be diſtinctly, and determinately reſolved; they would weather all oppoſition againſt their turning Scepticks, or Seekers (a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable term beſtowed by this complemental age upon wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drers from the true Religion) and never ſet down under any Miniſtry, or cloſe with any Religion, till they have found one exactly complying with their wild and irregular fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.

            <p>The rule therefore which conſtitutes this objection, and is ſo common in mens mouths upon ſundry occaſions, is not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nor frequently, and without evident neceſſity (ſuch as contradictions to other Scriptures, reaſon, ſenſe, hiſtorical veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp;c.) to be at all uſed.

Furthermore, Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly it makes the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle looſe his end in the ranking of thoſe officers.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Epiſtle to the Corinthians, takes juſt occaſion to reprove the pride and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of the Prophet, and gives rules for the avoidance of thoſe crimes and prevention of like checks for the future, 1 Cor. 14. <hi>per tot.</hi> And in the aforementioned Text, 1 Cor. 12.28. As it were of ſet purpoſe to humble, and moderate the Prophets Spirit, he placeth his chariſma, or the gift of Tongues in the loweſt claſſe of extraordinary donations, ſaying <hi>after that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, then gifts of healing, helps, governments, diverſities of tongues.</hi> In the arrogant abuſe of this gift, ſubſerving it to private oſtentation, not publick edification, the Prophet was moſt grievouſly peccant, he ſpeaking with tongues, that his parts might be magnified, not that the conſciences of the people might be inſtructed; wherefore as I ſaid the Apoſtle to humble him, placeth his admired gift, upon the loweſt ſeat in the Church, as upon a Stool of repentance. Wherein did St. <hi>Paul</hi> act (not to ſay ſpiritually, and ſpecially directed by the holy Ghoſt, which notwithſtanding was moſt true) but rationally, and out of a prudent intention, to bring the Prophet to the knowledge of himſelf and duty, how weakly doth he defeat his deſign of the expected ſucceſs, if while humbling the gift, he exalt the receiver to an undue place, and preheminency. For was it a ſin in the Prophet to be proud of a real gift; And was this a fit way to correct him, by perching him upon a place aſſigned to another, and his ſuperiour officer? would he abuſe Gods gift, to pride and vain glory, and would not he make the ſame miſimprovement of the Apoſtles miſtake? But why do I ſay miſtake, who could know the Evangeliſts proper place if St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not? Is it not he? who ſent forth, or took with him more who are accounted Evangeliſts by modern Divines, (and they have drawn the Catalogue far larger then any of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents) then all the reſt of the Apoſtles? And who only of all the Apoſtles, uſeth the word Evangeliſt in his writings: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth any other Scripture writer uſe it except St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who once gives Philip that title. Act. 21.8. but even then (and he never uſeth it in any other place) he brings St. <hi>Paul</hi> unto, and leaves him at <hi>Philips</hi> houſe; conſequently he could not chuſe but be very well acquainted with his office, and order in the Church. Moreover in this Epiſtle to the Corinthians St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls himſelf, <hi>a wiſe maſter builder,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.10. but wherein did his skill, or care anſwer that title, if in laying the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97860:26"/> ſtones where ought to be, and he ſeemingly uſeth moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, he heedleſly miſplaces two of the firſt three. We hope the ingenuous Reader is ſatisfied (if not by what we have ſaid, yet becauſe the Apoſtle hath aſſerted it twice) in the exactneſs of the Apoſtles order, and location of Prophets, not Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts next to the Apoſtles; neither need any more be added, but (if it be poſſible) to ſtop the mouth of gainſayers, we add; Fourthly the generality of learned men,<note place="margin">Fourthly Presbyters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg the Apoſtles order to be exact.</note> Presbyters and others acknowledge it.

Secondly, though the actions were, and might ſometimes be diverſe, yet they were not alwaies ſo, nor did the diſtinction conſiſt in the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate nature of the things, but in the ſeveral capacities of the hearers: For the Linguiſt might at once ſpeak with tongues, and propheſie unto intelligent perſons, while at the ſame time he ſcattered his words in the air, and was a Barbarian to the ignorant. Thirdly, a nigh obſerver will eaſily diſcern the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle evidencing in this ſeeming oppoſition, the ſubſerviency of tongues unto edification, which is the Prophets principal work, thus who ſpeaks with tongues ought <hi>to accommodate his diſcourſe to the capacity of his hearers.</hi> 1 Cor. 14.15. <hi>is to pray that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If they accept it in the former latitude;</p>
            <p>Then Chriſts Legiſlative power is impaired, and the new Teſtament Church-ſtate is not introduced by one Legiſlator, but by many Legiſlating Commiſſioners; Becauſe the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, who according to <hi>Beza, Faius,</hi> and <hi>Spanhemius,</hi> founded, or inſtituted Churches, were not of the ſame order with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and conſequently acted under another order and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, then that which Chriſt gave to his Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>If they take degree in the latter ſignification. Then,</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Apoſtolate (to which the firſt word in the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue or <hi>Apoſtles</hi> appertaineth) was both the higheſt order and degree in the Church; but if Propheſying, Evangelizing, Teaching, and Feeding, altered the degree or order of thoſe who diſcharged them, then the Apoſtles ſo oft as they wrought any of theſe works, deſcended into a lower ſtate or condition, then that wherein Chriſt had conſtituted them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, all the former Definitions are faulty, and vicious in the non-aſſignation of the Evangeliſts order, whether it were the Apoſtolate, or the Presbyterate; or wherein his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree differed from other officers of the ſame order.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the diſtinct and ſeparate Definition of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, as neither an Apoſtle nor a Presbyter, but inferior to the one, and ſuperiour to the other in Office-works, is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of a third order, for ſuch inferiority, and ſuperiority are the plaineſt, and moſt viſible characters of order and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.

            <p>We will try whether thoſe pillars be built upon the rock, or upon the ſand, our ſearch ſhall begin with the firſt of them, which is,</p>

There is ſome ambiguity in the term planted, 'tis borrowed from husbandry,<note place="margin">Firſt in one ſenſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did not plant the Church.</note> and <hi>originally</hi> notes the ſowing of the firſt ſeed of a vegetable, be it herb, flower, grain, &amp;c. or the immediate entrance upon a country improvement. In this ſenſe we deny that either the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> planted the Church, for Chriſt the chief husbandman, firſt took in that vineyard, and appointed the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and all other Miniſters to be but labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and ſervants under him to dreſs, and look after it.</p>

And alſo much of that work, call it by what name you will, hath been done ſince the death both of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> &amp; of the ſuppoſed <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> as will ſoon appear by a ſearch after the originals of moſt Churches now in being. Let me add, much, if not moſt of that work remains undone untill this day, the greateſt part of the world being unconverted, and muſt for ever continue ſo, if propagating Churches, were the diſtinct and incommunicable work of the firſt Church-officers: So that no preſent Church-officers have a power to preach unto the <hi>Turks, Jews, Tartars, Perſians,</hi> and other numberleſs uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Nations in the four quarters of the world, and to ſettle them in a Church eſtate upon their converſion. I am not now to be told, that the firſt Officers were builders, preſent Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are conſervers, and maintainers of Churches, or what vaſt difference theſe terms are conceived to put betwixt them. But let it be told me never ſo often, I ſhall never take it for a truth; till it ſhall be proved that Chriſt was not our Legiſlator; that he did not promiſe a perpetual preſence to an Apoſtolical ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Miniſters: That no Church hath been formed out of a before unconverted people, ſince the death of the <hi>twelve firſt Apoſtles.</hi> That never any more like Churches ſhall be formed hereafter: And that the building <hi>Apoſtles</hi> preached another word, adminiſtred other Sacraments, exerciſed conſtantly, and officially other cenſure, then conſerving Miniſters, can now preach, adminiſter, or exerciſe. This firſt reaſon therefore, for the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> ſupply of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> places, as their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, becauſe the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> planted, and the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> watered Churches, is no reaſon.

               </note> Beſides what ever <hi>Calvin</hi> meant by this proof of <hi>Barnabas</hi> his <hi>Evangelizate,</hi> he did not long continue to have a value for it, and gives ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why any one of an ordinary capacity ſhould ſlight, ſcorn, and reject it, for in the following words, he adds, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs becauſe he was added to St.</hi> Paul <hi>as his collegue, we ſet hoth in the ſame degree of office, and ſo the title Apoſtle will truly agree to</hi> Barnabas. Theſe are <hi>Calvins</hi> reaſons for <hi>Barnabas</hi> his Evangelizate. <hi>Mareſius</hi> ſaith, Paul <hi>was moſt forward in ſpeaking.</hi> But this is a meer cracke of words, weak, and frivolous, becauſe, Firſt, forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or backwardneſs of ſpeaking, is no argument of the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Church-officers; If it were, not Chriſts commiſſion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mareſius</hi> his reaſon is no reaſon.</note> and ordination purſuant to it, but a natural fervour, and readineſs of utterance would conſtitute the higheſt order of Church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Secondly, <hi>Mareſius</hi> his argument for St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, rather then <hi>Barnabas's;</hi> or his forwardneſs of ſpeaking is retorted upon St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by the <hi>Sect-maſters</hi> at <hi>Corinth</hi> to prove him no Apoſtle. 2 Cor. 10.10. they ſnarle at his defective ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, as he himſelf complains, <hi>For his letters ſay they are
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97860:41"/> weighty, and powerful, but his bodily preſence is weak, and his ſpeech is contemptible.</hi> And 2 Cor. 11.5.6. He is neceſſitated to maintain his equality with the other Apoſtles, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his rudeneſs, or being an <hi>Ideot</hi> in ſpeech. He ſaith, <hi>For I ſuppoſe, I was not a whit behind the very chiefeſt Apoſtles, for though I be rude in ſpeech</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) <hi>yet not in knowledge, but we have been throughly made manifeſt among you in all things.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Barnabas</hi> hath a very high commendation in St. <hi>Lukes</hi> hiſtory, for his grace and ability to miniſter the oracles of God, Act. 11.23, 24. <hi>Who when he (Barnabas</hi> read v. 22.) <hi>came, and had ſeen the grace of God, he was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpoſe of heart they would cleave unto the Lord, for he was a good man, and full of the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly Ghoſt, and of faith, and much people were added unto the Lord.</hi> Beſides probably the Apoſtles ſirnamed him <hi>Barnabas,</hi> or the Son of conſolation, with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his gifts in exhortation, Act. 4.36. For let <hi>Bar</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with the <hi>Hebrew nabba,</hi> or with the <hi>Syriack nabba,</hi> either way it as well denotes, a Son of exhortation, as of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, or rather a Son of conſolation, by exhortation. And the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, whereby St. <hi>Luke</hi> expounds ths name <hi>Barnabas,</hi> ſignifies both <hi>official exhortation.</hi> Act. 13.5. Rom. 12.8. 1 Tim. 4.13. and <hi>beneficial conſolation.</hi> 2 Cor. 1.3. And <hi>Barnabas</hi> was renowned for both, he was <hi>Barnabas,</hi> a Son of exhortation by his doctrine, and he was <hi>Barnabas</hi> a Son of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation by his charity. Fourthly, let <hi>Mareſius</hi> his <hi>praeibat in loquendo</hi> be referred, not to natural forwardneſs, but prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and power of order, ſo that St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeaking before, or when <hi>Barnabas</hi> held his peace, muſt be accounted an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove the ſuperiority of the ones, and the inferiority of the others offices; By the ſame reaſon St. <hi>Peter</hi> was not only ſupreme over, but of a diſtinct order from the other Apoſtles, he very often making uſe of this precedency of diſcourſe, Act. 1.15. Act. 2.14. ver. 37, 38. Act. 3.4. ver. 12. Act. 4.8. Act. 5.3. ver. 9. Act. 8.20. &amp;c.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>All proof therefore of <hi>Barnabas</hi> his Evangelizate is wanting, and want we may long enough, when ſuch eminent perſons as <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Mareſius,</hi> can bring no better. But we have proof ſufficient for his Apoſtolate,<note place="margin">Videtur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquatenus adjungendus Barnabas. Bez. ad Eph. <hi>4.11.</hi>
               </note> St. <hi>Luke</hi> richly furniſhing us with a fourfold teſtimony, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> with a double. St. <hi>Luke</hi> witneſſeth;</p>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that they were both Apoſtles. Act. 14.14. <hi>Which when the Apoſtles</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>heard of, they rent their clothes and ran in among the people, crying out.</hi> They were now at <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra,</hi> where ſuch a Majeſty of the divine power attended their joynt Miniſtry, and <hi>Barnabas's</hi> in particular; as the amazed people reckoned him for <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> for <hi>Mercury</hi> ver. 12. Who knows not but that theſe amazed Heathens did mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the true quality of the Apoſtles, however from their act is colligible, that they were ſo far from obſerving any inferio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in <hi>Barnabas</hi> to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as contrariwiſe they accounted him the father of St. <hi>Paul</hi> (had he been <hi>Mercury</hi>) and of other their miſconceived deities.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they acted joyntly in Apoſtolick works. Act. 14.23. <hi>And when</hi> they (St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas;</hi> ſee ver. 22.) <hi>had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Anſ. to Diſſenters P. 20. <hi>London.</hi> 1648.</note> The <hi>diſſenting brethren</hi> infer from this act of St. <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas</hi> that <hi>there remains a power of ordination in any two elders at this day.</hi> Whereunto the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> anſwer; <hi>For ought our brethren have ſhewed to the contrary, ſome of thoſe elders might be ordained by</hi> Paul, <hi>ſome by</hi> Barnabas, <hi>and not all by both joyntly.</hi> Whereby they grant, that the faculty to do this work was diſtinct, and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, at their parting <hi>Barnabas</hi> aſſumes <hi>Mark</hi> into the ſame partnerſhip of his work, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> took <hi>Sylas;</hi> Act. 15.39<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 40. which is a further demonſtration that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had no coercive power over him,<note place="margin">Videmus hic qualiter ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum officia inter ſe diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buerunt, nem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe ut Paulus, &amp; Barnabas gentium eſſent Apoſtoli, alii autem Judeo rum.

            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Barnabas</hi> had (as St. <hi>Paul</hi>) a power to abſtain from working, and to expect a maintainance from the Churches, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Neither in that ſenſe can it be a proper mark of an Apoſtle, ſince it was occaſionally practicable by all private Chriſtians, and is accordingly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Churches both at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Corinth.</hi> Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the third phraſe, or <hi>have I not ſeen Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> we ſhall add no more then what hath been ſaid already: The fourth or laſt phraſe, or <hi>Are not ye my work in the Lord?</hi> is of all the reſt the moſt unlikely to give a ſpecial mark of an Apoſtle. Since the converſion of the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> (a like work with that ſpoken of in this text) was <hi>The work of the Lord wrought by Philip the Evangeliſt?</hi> but he was no Apoſtle; and ſince there hath much (not to ſay more then in the Apoſtles lives) of that work been done ſince their deaths. The truth therefore is, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not intend in this place to give the proper marks of the Apoſtolate, but occurs to ſome vulgar inſinuations, urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Apoſtleſhip. And endeavours to prove, that even in thoſe things which they magnified in the other Apoſtles, he was no whit their inferiour. But to proceed, ſecondly, the Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived their office unto others.<note place="margin">Secondly the Apoſtles derived their office unto others.</note> This is provable by many Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, but we ſhall limit our ſearch at this time, unto the ſingle inſtance of <hi>Mathias,</hi> recorded, Act. 1. there we read, how ſhortly after Chriſts aſcenſion, and before the miraculous effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of extraordinary gifts, the Apoſtles met with the hundred and twenty, and St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſtanding up in the midd'ſt, opens the reaſons and grounds of that aſſembly; namely to put one into the Office of Apoſtate <hi>Judas.</hi> This he urgeth upon them with ſome vehemency, and among other expreſſions ſaith, Act. 1.21. <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>it muſt be done,</hi> or it was by no means to be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The moſt probable reaſon of which earneſtneſs, ſeems to be the the nature of <hi>Judas</hi> his Office, which was not perſonal in him, but <gap reason="foreign">

But return we to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the hundred and twenty; he having told them that the vacancy made by <hi>Judas</hi> in the Apoſtolick Office muſt be ſupplied, they fall upon it, two are choſen, whoſe merits being equal the Apoſtles ſubmit their title unto a lot, which falls upon <hi>Mathias.</hi> Out of which Hiſtory I collect two obſervables. Firſt, that the Apoſtolical Office was derivable, and not perſonally limited and fixed to the firſt twelve, for then <hi>Judas,</hi> which compleated the number could have no ſucceſſor: but <hi>Mathias</hi> ſucceeded him into his whole Office; compare Act. 1.17. where we read what <hi>Judas</hi> left behinde him; <hi>for he was numbered with us, and obtained part of this miniſtry.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, That Biſhop and Apoſtle, were terms convertible in S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, and did ſignifie one and the ſome Officer of the Apoſtolical Order: for of that Order <hi>Matthias</hi> was, when he was ordained Biſhop in the ſtead of <hi>Judas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That in S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Judgement the Apoſtolate was a derivable Office, and fixed in the Church, otherwiſe he would never have ſaid <hi>Matthias</hi> was ordained Biſhop in the ſtead of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> much leſs would he have drawn that ordination into a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

That <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> wrought no miracles, is confeſſed, but there may be ſeveral reaſons given for it; &amp; why it is not to be drawn into juſtifying preſident of the want of thoſe gifts, in any now pretended extraordinary Officer: For <hi>John</hi> was the immediate forerunner of Chriſt; that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come, was the conſtant and ordinary belief, and at this time the raiſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Jews, unto whom he preached, and affirmed <hi>de facto</hi> that he was come. This was a more direct way to prove his doctrine, then working of mirales; for miracles may be feined, in his preaching could be no deceit; If his Auditors turned to their Bibles, and found what the antient Prophets
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97860:81"/> predicted concerning the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> verified in Chriſt, they had reaſon to beleive their Preacher, otherwiſe they might reject both as deceivers: This if I miſtake not, is a reaſon aſſigned by the holy Ghoſt, why <hi>John</hi> wrought no miracles; Joh. 10.41. <hi>And many reſorted unto him, and ſaid, John indeed wrought no miracles, but all that he ſaid of this man were true;</hi> how ſoon <hi>John</hi> ſpake of Chriſt, and how he protects himſelf under the wings of his authority, when queſtioned for doing ſomewhat reputed extraordinary; appears by Joh. 1.25, 26, 27. <hi>And they asked him, and ſaid; why baptizeſt thou then? if thou be not the Chriſt, nor Elias, nor that Prophet, John anſwered them ſaying, I baptize you with water, but there ſtandeth one among you, whom you know not, he it is, &amp;c.</hi> The ſum of all this is, <hi>John was a cryer, or Herald.</hi> Joh. 1.22. who gave notice of the coming, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the longed for Saviour; whoſe meſſage could be no otherwiſe confirmed then by Chriſts preſence: Miracles would do no good without it, and were needleſs with it. Perhaps al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo our Lord reſerved thoſe largeſſes of the divine bounty to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

A Church is ſaid to be reformed, ſo far as sſhe frees her ſelf from the corruption of a deformed Church, with whom ſhe former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held communion and fellowſhip. This is an act of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt nature and moſt important conſideration, to the whole State of Chriſtianity, not to be thought of, much leſs attempted, till all other means have been tried and found fruitleſs: that we are all one body, minds us not lightly to conſent to the abſciſion of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97860:89"/> any member, though corrupted, for till peril of gangreening be imminent and unavoidable, the grounds of hope are equal, that by good Medicines, and the ſtrength and vigour in the ſound parts, the corrupt may be aſſiſted to expel the noxious humour, and amend, with thoſe of fear, leaſt the ſound be concorrupted by them. Several Churches of Apoſtolical plantation, as <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, Galatia,</hi> &amp;c. were full of groſs humours, and corrupt members, but S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not immediately threaten them with an excommunication, and cutting off from all other Churches; but contrariwiſe, he inſiſts upon councels, intreaties, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Remedies, how they might reform themſelves. But granting (as there may be) a juſt and reaſonable cauſe for ſuch departure and reformation from a corrupt Church; what is done ſhould be apprehended and carried with the feeling of a Patient looſing a Limb, and with the Care and Conſcience of a skilful Chyrurgion, who cut off no more then is ulcered, and not to be continued without danger to the body. To conclude corruption in all, from unſoundneſs in ſome members, is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly deſtructive to every body, either <hi>Natural, Civil,</hi> or <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical.</hi> A foul Church hath ſome part clean, or ſhe is no Church at all. Neither doth Reformation terminate in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt imaginable diſtance from her, but in keeping as far from her, as ſhe is from her ſelf when ſhe was primitive. <hi>The name Reformation aſſures us, that once ſhe had a right form, and retains ſome part of it, otherwiſe ſhe cannot be reformed, but muſt be formed a Church ere ſhe be one. A Mahumetan doth not reform, but turn Chriſtian. Receſſion from what a corrupt Church holds in common with the primitive, is no Reformation, but an equal departure from both.</hi> Wherefore let the Objector prove, that all Churches thus reformed from Romiſh ſuperſtition, allow of the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt Ordinary and Extraordinary Officers, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally admit but of one teaching Order of Miniſters, we will take no diſadvantage to his prejudice of his former failure, but we are certain he equally failes in this, as in the other, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>Saxoniſh, Swediſh, Daniſh,</hi> (not to mention the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Abyſſyne</hi>) the Church of <hi>England</hi> (not onely the faireſt Flower in, but the Wall and Defence about the whole Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Reformation) excludes her ſelf from their number: She being divinely directed in her Reformation unto this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed temper, ſhe left the corruptions of <hi>preſent Rome,</hi> and was content to hold Communion with her (if ſhe pleaſed) in what was <hi>Rome primitive,</hi> whereby at once ſhe avoided the ſcandal of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:97860:90"/> Novelty and Faction, and left an open door to <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf to reform, if ſhe liſted. Her Judgement about extraordinary Miniſters,<note place="margin">Articles of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> Art. 23.</note> ſhe delivers thus: <hi>It is not lawful for any man to take upon him the Office of publick preaching, or miniſtring the Sacraments in the congregation, before he be lawfully called, and ſent to execute the ſame; and thoſe we ought to judge to be lawfully called and ſent, which be choſen and called to this work by men, who have publick authority given them in the congregation, to call and ſend Miniſters into the Lords vineyard.</hi> Thus the Article. And for the Orders of her Miniſters, ſhe judged it unſafe to invent a new frame, becauſe of corruption in the Romiſh Hierarchy, but veiwing the primitive conſtitution of <hi>Apoſtles and Elders,</hi> how comely doth ſhe frame her ſelf by <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> (not Sacrificers, but the contraction of Presbyters) both diſtinctly named in her Book of Articles, whereunto all her Miniſters were ſworn, and thoſe who were conſcientious of their Oaths, ſtrenuouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended both againſt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Geneva.</hi> The diſtinguiſhing Rails betwixt which two Orders, ſhe viſibly placed in a ſolemn and peremptory confinement of either Officer within and exerciſe of different official Actions.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, but in the Criſis of her late, and in ſome meaſure yet-continuing Agony, ſhe was hardly able to put forth her power according to her principles, which raſh judging ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers imputed to the crazedneſs of her firſt frame, not to the multitude of ill humours, then drawing to a conſiſtencie, and heading in the Diſtemper under which ſhe yet labours; yea even at that time ſo out-ragiouſly violent upon her, that if any of her more obedient Sons durſt aſſert the Divine Right of her higher Order of Officers, he was inſtantly clamoured againſt for a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veliſt, becauſe Faction had over-perſwaded her open-ear'd par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it was grounded upon an Act of Parliament, not Chriſts Inſtitution.

            </p>
            <p>Here are ſeveral things practiced by the Apoſtles granted to be perpetual, others extraordinary; We yeild willingly the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but (notwithſtanding this great Divines cenſure of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers) we muſt animadvert ſomething upon the latter. What is truly, and properly Apoſtolical, he accounts underivable, conſequently.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This denies the <hi>power of the keyes, preaching, and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins</hi> to be truly, or properly Apoſtolical works, and yet they are required of them by Chriſts expreſs commiſſion. Joh 20.23. Mat. 28.19.20.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It overthrows all proper, and true ſucceſſion to the Apoſtles. And conſequently, the Biſhops whom he allows to ſucceed the Apoſtles, do ſucceed them neither truly, nor properly; which to my ſenſe is irreconciliable to the nature of Succeſſion; ſince the Succeſſor truly, and properly enters upon what the Predeceſſor enjoyed. I know in temporal poſſeſſions, one Predeceſſor may have ſeveral Succeſſors, A Father may divide his Lands among many Sons, all of them are his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, but none of them enjoy his whole eſtate. But this will no whit advantage <hi>Whitakers</hi> opinion till it ſhall be proved, that preſent Church-officers ſucceed the Apoſtles in nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Apoſtolical, and that what he accounts truly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Apoſtolical, and conſequently underivable were the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and proprieties of the Apoſtolick Office: I bear in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well enough what he hath ſaid, but muſt profeſs before the world, that I cannot allow his <hi>Criteria's,</hi> or <hi>preaching to the whole world, writing of Scriptures, working of Miracles, gift of Tongues, caſting out Devils, and treading upon Serpents;</hi> to give
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:97860:98"/> a certain character of the proper, and true Apoſtolick Office, diſtinct from what is derived to their Succeſſors, for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of theſe matters were no part of the Apoſtolick Office, but extraordinary gifts, and what is Official is at this day pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable by their Succeſſors; for inſtance; their <hi>preaching to the whole world,</hi> is the only Office work mentioned by <hi>Whitaker</hi> among his ſuppoſed extraordinary Apoſtolical works. And this to this day is incumbent upon their Succeſſors. We have ſpoken ſomewhat of this already, pag. 89. And ſhall add more, pag. 290. out of this diſcourſe. If all, or any of which, ſhall ſatisfie our Reader, it will convince him; that though this work was truly Apoſtolical, yet it was not ſo proper to the firſt Apoſtles, as to diſtinguiſh them, as men of another Order from their preſent Succeſſors; becauſe others beſides the twelve A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did it in the Apoſtles dayes; and becauſe much, if not moſt of that work remains undone until this day.</p>
            <p>All the reſt mentioned by <hi>Whitaker</hi> were ſpecial gifts, at neither <hi>truely,</hi> nor <hi>properly</hi> appertaining to the Apoſtolick Offic. For example, he inſtanceth in <hi>Goſpel-writing.</hi> I grant the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were imployed in this work, but not <hi>properly,</hi> and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively of all other men, for then we ſhould have no Pen-men of holy Writ but Apoſtles, whereas St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi> were Scripture writers, but none of the twelve Apoſtles: Nor was it <hi>truely</hi> an Apoſtolical work, ſo as to diſtinguiſh an Apoſtle from an Officer of an other Order, for then <hi>Andrew, Philip, Barthol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew, Thaddeus,</hi> one, if not both the <hi>James</hi>'s, <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Obj.</note> and <hi>Mathias</hi> were truly no Apoſtles. Do any ſay theſe Apoſtles did, or might write Scripture, though they did not write it, or if they writ, their writings are not come to our hands.<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
            </p>
            <p>We can oppoſe a reaſon againſt either member of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If theſe Apoſtles did write books of Canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and they are periſhed, then have we not the Canon of the Scripture entire. And ſo great a flaw being found in Gods providence towards the preſervation of his Oracles, as to ſuffer the writings of the major part of the Apoſtles to periſh; thoſe who pleaſe, may either thence take advantage to deny the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and validity of the reſt, or to vend new Enthuſiaſmes, under the ſpecious pretexts of the recovery of the writings of theſe Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whereas it is ſuppoſed that ſome Apoſtles might

But let
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:97860:100"/> us conſider what <hi>Bucanus</hi> hath done; Tit. 1.5. is his leading proof, there we read. <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in Creet, that thou ſhouldſt ſet in order the things that are wanting, and ordain Elders in every City, as I had appointed thee.</hi> Here is the words of the Text, but where is the Evangeliſt? or how ſhall we know it treats of an Evangeliſt? Are we anſwered, that although the word Evangeliſt be not Syllabically written in it, yet what was ſo loudly called for before anſwers here, namely <hi>Titus</hi> did the ſame works at <hi>Creet,</hi> as <hi>Timothy</hi> did at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> but <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> is called an Evangeliſt, therefore he and <hi>Titus</hi> are both of them Evangeliſts.

But in finding two Evangeliſts, we have loſt two other things, viz.

Suffice this in examination of his third, proceed we to his fourth Text, which is 2. Tim. 4.11, 12. This is his proof of three Evangeliſts, let us read it, and heed it well; the words are. <hi>Only Luke is with me, take Mark and bring him along with thee, for he is profitable unto me for the Miniſtry; And Tychicus have I ſent to Epheſus.</hi> Here are three men named, <hi>Luk, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It lay by the Foot-ſteps of their former Flocks, and antient Shepheards Tents; eſpecially in thoſe ages, and Theological exerciſes, when <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> moderated in the Schools of the prophets. This (let others take what path they pleaſe) ſeems to me to be the ſafeſt way; becauſe unleſs our Religion be new, and of this daies birth, we ought to conform to yeſterdaies, and elder obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Chriſtianity (if ever it will be) is of ſufficient age to exact our imitation of former patterns, and needs not leave us to excogitate new forms of Divine worſhip. But becauſe leſs knowing, and more preſuming ſpirits had found out a ſhorter cut, haſtening, and hollaing on their party with inceſſant clamours to follow them, no matter what, or whoſe Fences, or Incloſures they brake down, and laid waſt, therefore theſe high wayes were unoccuppied, and the Travailer choſe by-wayes: And there hath been War in the gate.

               </p>
               <p>All theſe Authors grant, that <hi>Cornelius</hi> was ſome way or other prepared to receive the Goſpel, ere he ſent for <hi>Peter;</hi> Indeed they do not name <hi>Philip</hi> to be employed in that ſervice. But ſince the Nation of the Jews were generally enemies to the Chriſt then manifeſted, and ſince the holy Ghoſt brings <hi>Philip</hi> too, and leaves him Evangelizing at <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> Act. 8.40. We do therefore (and we doubt not deſervedly) aſcribe it to his Miniſtry. But we ſhall not any longer inſiſt upon it, what makes moſt for our purpoſe is moſt certain; namely, after <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> is once ſettled at <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> we are not warranted by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to remove him from thence.

Beza</hi> runs as faſt as words can carry him to our ſide; he ſaith, <hi>Of neceſſity we muſt confeſs, that this text treats of the Original of the Epheſme Church.</hi> And again: <hi>The Apoſtles demanding whether they had received the gift of the holy Ghoſt, would thereby learn of them, whether they had received thoſe gifts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God was then wont peculiarly to adorn Church-Officers.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he adds, <hi>They were called by God to the ſacred Miniſtry, to wit by the gift of tongues and prophecie.</hi> And finally he ſaith, without all doubt, <hi>they were conſtituted the Guides and Governours of that Church.

This they warily decline in this place, but in their Annotations upon the Text,<note place="margin">Annotat. ad Act. 19.6. 4.

               <p>Fourthly, This is not onely a Preſbyterian notion, for learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men of the Epiſcopal Judgement, do not a little favour it.

                  </note> Unto Doctor <hi>Heylin,</hi> I could adde ſeveral others, but his reaſon to prove the twelve prophets to be Church-Officers, becauſe they did Office-works, or propheſied, is one of the moſt principal reaſons which can be alleadged in that matter, and for one man to ſay the ſame thing which Scripture doth, is of equal force as if a thouſand ſaid it, becauſe the ſame reaſon which weakens a Scripture truely aſſerted by one man, would in like manner invalidate it, if it were maintained by the whole creation.</p>
               <p>Thus have we inſtanced in what muſt be ſaid againſt <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Evangelizate at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> more might be added, but we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give<note n="*" place="margin">The terms <hi>Calviniſts, Calviniſm,</hi> &amp;c. ſometime uſed are intended only for terms of diſtinction, and to avoid a more tedious way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, not as marks of diſgrace, or contempt.</note>

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:97860:120"/> ſilent) <hi>Beza,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> tell us this fair ſtory; they ſay <hi>The Orator Alexander was St. Pauls moſt pernitious enemy, mentioned</hi> 1 Tim. 1.14. <hi>and delivered by him to Sathan,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.20. <hi>which Alexander,</hi>

                  <hi>the Jews at this time carry forth of the croud into a fit place, where by an invective Oration he might appeaſe the inraged people, revile them to the Jews, and derive all their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice upon St. Paul and the Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Judgment of this ſtory briefly is, 'tis but a Tale, For.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Thoſe who put <hi>Alexander</hi> forward, are plainly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced in the text from thoſe that drew him forth; the words in the original are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This <hi>Beza</hi> himſelf thus tranſlates, <hi>Ex tucla vero produxerunt quidam Alexandrum propellentibus eum Judaeis.</hi> And all other tranſlations obſerve the difference, except the <hi>Syriack,</hi> which rather paraphraſeth, then tranſlates.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Gentile <hi>Epheſians</hi> were equally incenſed both againſt Jews and Chriſtians; Particularly they were ſo far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged againſt the Jews, as perceiving <hi>Alexander</hi> to be a Jew, they would not ſuffer him to ſpeak, ver. 34. <hi>But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice, about the ſpace of two h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>urs cryed out, Great is Diana of the Epheſians.</hi> Beſides had not the <hi>Epheſians</hi> been offended both againſt Jews and Chriſtians, the Jews needed not to have thruſt <hi>Alexander</hi> forward to make any Apology for them; becauſe <hi>Demetrius</hi> took his firſt diſtaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Chriſtians,<note place="margin">In loc.</note> and had thrown the contempt upon them. We are therefore with <hi>Beza's</hi> good leave yet to ſeek for the true expoſition of the text, and ſhall not be able to find it, till we can aſſign the difference betwixt thoſe who drew <hi>Alexan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> forth, and Jews who put him forward.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> agreeing with <hi>Beza</hi> in the reſt, ſaw this, and to help <hi>Dun out of the mire,</hi> he adds. <hi>Thoſe who drew A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander forth were Serjeants, thoſe who thruſt him forward were Jews, malicious to St. Paul, who queſtioned and examined him, and then he was ready to Apologize,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Id ubi ſupra</note> 
                  <hi>to avert the danger from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to turn it upon others.</hi> This Expoſition he grounds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſecular uſage of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> namely, <hi>that it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to examin judicially a ſuſpected, or impleaded delinquent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as well this, as <hi>Heſychicus his gloſs muſt be mended.</hi> For</p>
               <p>Firſt, 'Tis utterly improbable, that the Town Officers ſhould ſuffer the Jews to examin their Priſoner.</p>

               <p>Secondly, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> hath no ſuch Scripture Signification, nor if it had elſewhere would this text admit it, till it were proved, that the Magiſtracy of <hi>Epheſus</hi> conſiſted of Jews.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, 'Tis ſomewhat too confident (though animated by our tranſlation) to ſay, that <hi>Alexander</hi> would have made his own defence, for the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.)</p>
               <p>Fourthly, 'Tis yet more confident to ſay that <hi>Alexander</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to accuſe others, for no word properly ſignifying to accuſe, appears in the text. Neither will the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The errors whereunto theſe Authors draw themſelves, and confiding Readers, proceed (I dare ſay it) from want of due conſideration of the ſeveral words rendred <hi>drew forth,</hi> and <hi>put forward;</hi> the former <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:97860:121"/> both of them were for the moſt part originally Jews; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the enraged <hi>Epheſians</hi> knew not before, much leſs would they in their preſent rage make any difference betwixt Jews and Chriſtians; ſure I am, the men of <hi>Thyatyra</hi> did not, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining to their Magiſtrates againſt St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas,</hi> they ſay Act. 16.20. <hi>Theſe men being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Therefore the cauſe, and danger both of Jews and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans being the ſame, there is no reaſon why they might concur in the election in a common advocate to make their joynt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, leaſt both ſhould be ſwallowed up promiſcuouſly in thoſe tempeſtuous waves of popular fury. To this Expoſition good Authors aſſent;<note place="margin">In loc.</note> namely <hi>Aretius, Piſcator,</hi> and <hi>A Lapide;</hi> neither is it any whit diſcountenanced by the following words, or what is ſaid of the Jews, that <hi>they put him forward;</hi> for that word doth not alwaies ſignifie a violent haling, and thruſting out of a malicious intent: In <hi>Scripture</hi> it is uſed of <hi>trees, bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or ſprouting,</hi> Luke 21.30. Among <hi>Authors</hi> 'tis uſed, as well of a parties producing his witneſſes in Court, as of the Judges examination of them; In which caſes the Party is oft-times enforced to uſe all violences of intreaty, promiſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Subpoena's,</hi> and threatnings of hazard to his witneſſes, if they neglect their appearance to put them forward, leaſt the cauſe ſhould be heard in his abſence, and go againſt him; the reſult of what hath been ſaid is this, that the Chriſtians drawing <hi>Alexander</hi> forth by inſtruction, the Jews might put him forward, haſten and encourage him to proceed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Apology. And certainly any one in his caſe would have needed both Spurs.</p>
               <p>This I am perſwaded is the true meaning of the place, and I wonder that <hi>Beza</hi> and Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> neither took notice of it,<note place="margin">In loc.</note> nor of ſome as learned as themſelves, to wit, <hi>Cajetane,</hi> and <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> who deny the <hi>Alexander</hi> named in this Text to be the ſame named, and excommunicated by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.20. <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place leaves it with an <hi>incertum eſt,</hi> or <hi>it is incertain whether they were both one man, or divers.</hi> This is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, but the other opinion ſeems trueſt. But grant both Texts ſpeak of one and the ſame <hi>Alexander,</hi> this in the Acts gives no colourable reaſon why an excommunication ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt him, but he was actually excommunicated 1 Tim. 1.20.</p>
               <p>Wherefore again and again, we affirm and repeat, that the charge given to the <hi>Epheſme Elders at Miletum</hi> was prophetical
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:97860:121"/> of thoſe future miſchiefs, which falſe teachers ſhould do unto that Church, unleſs they were watcht againſt with all diligence: And that the Propheſie had in part its accompliſhment in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> delivery of <hi>Hymeneus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander unto Sathan,</hi> ere he directed the firſt Epiſtle unto <hi>Timothy:</hi> Suffice this for the fourth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the aſſigned date of the firſt Epiſtle unto <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</hi>

                  </note> as others have done before me.

               <p>Thirdly, Others interpret the text of ſome time after St. <hi>Pauls</hi> releaſe from his firſt impriſonment when he perambulated, and travailed over again his former Stages: thus <hi>A Lapide.</hi> The firſt, and laſt of theſe expoſitions are only probable,<note place="margin">In loc.</note> the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt moſt improbable and falſe, our preſent enquiry is, which of the two is moſt probable: Do any ſay the <hi>firſt</hi> is? becauſe <hi>Trophimus</hi> was not left ſick at <hi>Miletum</hi> when <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17. was written, I anſwer:</p>

               <p>The Modern Opinion, ſuppoſe it were true, allows the ſecond Epiſtle to be written two full years diſtant from the date of the firſt Epiſtle, the ſame Authors acknowledging that to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in A.

               <p>Philips <hi>courage and ſufficiency</hi> is atteſted, both by the time of

Then Philip went down unto the city of Samaria, and preached Chriſt unto them.</hi> And by the temper of the people to whom he went, which appears both in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, Acts 4.5. and by <hi>verſe</hi> 34.35. <hi>And the Eunuch anſwered Philip, and ſaid, I pray thee of whom ſpeaketh the Prophet this, of himſelf, or of ſome other man?

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Infidelity</hi> of <hi>Philips</hi> Auditors is demonſtrated, partly, by the place of their habitation, <hi>Samaria,</hi> whereinto our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour forbad the Apoſtles to enter, Mat. 10.5. <hi>Thoſe twelve Jeſus ſent forth, and commanded them ſaying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any City of the Samaritans enter ye not.</hi> And eſpecially, by the character of thoſe perſons to whom <hi>Philip</hi> preached, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.9, 10, 11. <hi>But there was a certain man called Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which before time in the ſame City, uſed ſorcery, and bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the people of Samaria, giving out that himſelf was ſome great one; to whom they all gave heed from the leaſt to the greateſt, ſaying, This man is the great power of God; and to him they had regard, becauſe that of long time he had bewitched them with his ſorceries.</hi>

               <p>And in one, or other of theſe two ſenſes, it is uſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the New Teſtament.

The ſplendor of the Apoſtolate, is not hereby ecclipſed or impaired: The Apoſtles neither thought ſo, at the Impoſition, neither do they aſſign it for the reaſon of their depoſition of the Diaconate; but the growing occaſions for the exerciſe of their proper Office-works, as preaching, prayers, &amp;c. Acts 6.2, 3, 4. The reaſon is evident, becauſe the Church comes under conſideration in a double notion, <hi>either</hi> as a <hi>diſtinct</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Polity and Society, or as a <hi>common</hi> and general Polity or Society: As the former, ſhe hath her proper Ordinances, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and Officers, not of her own election, but of her Law-givers Inſtitution: Theſe are, and muſt be perpetually the ſame, each Ordinance muſt always have the ſame form, each Officer muſt invariably do the ſame works, where the occaſions are the ſame. Otherwiſe her firſt frame will be taken in pieces, and what formed her diſtinct Society, will be diſſolved. As the latter, ſhe admits or rejects at pleaſure, what being uſed in other Societies, is uſeful, or uſeleſs, for her occaſions. Whatſoever Ordinances or Conſtitutions ſhe maketh in this capacity, they are variable, ſhe may retain them as long, or change them as often as ſhe pleaſeth; and while they continue, ſhe may diſpenſe them by any Officer or member at her own election. We reckon the Diaconate mentioned Act 6. or the miniſtration to the poor, and ſerving of tables, in this latter ſort of Ordinances; and ſay the primitive Church gave it entertainment, and the Apoſtles diſcharged it as ſuch.</p>

Gods uſual method to try the right ſtrain of his <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> Saints, is to expoſe them to the hot Sun of perſecution, in its ſeveral aſcents and exaltations.

Thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> newly victorious in one conflict at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> is comforted with aſſurance of ſucceſs in another combate at <hi>Rome,</hi> Act 23.11. when God once findes what the ſhoulders of his people can bear, he not onely proportions their burthen to their ſtrength, but commands them as more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to his glory, and their good; not to ſtand ſtill, or ſink under it, but ſo to carry it, as others may diſcern, that their load melts away, and is the lighter, the longer they ſtand under it, becauſe they feel equal ſtrength from one hand of God ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them, as weight from the other afflicting them.

                  <hi>The Office of the Evangeliſt being to preach to unbelievers, requires not the donation of all the Epiſcopal power,</hi> viz. <hi>of ruling, nor the power of all

               <p>Thus have we proved our whole definition, and dare boldly queſtion the moroſeſt Reader, what it doth contain, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or agreeable to a yet continuing Church Officer: Certainly preaching and baptizing are permanent acts of Office, whoſe performance is perpetually neceſſary in a conſtituted Church, neither can any new Church be conſtituted without them; yea, if the Church be not ſpread throughout the whole Word; if the Jews, or any other Nation under Heaven, remain uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, they muſt continue for ever in that deſperate eſtate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Church can commiſſionate ſome Preaching to go unto them, and to baptize them, &amp;c.

But we ſhall adde another, that in the mouth of two witneſſes, this thing may be confirmed: S. <hi>Peter</hi> coming to <hi>Antioch</hi> (a Church where S. <hi>Paul</hi> had been Prophet, or Teacher, and whence he receives his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical miſſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) where not carrying himſelf uprightly in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> judgement, he both reproves and cenſures him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withſtood him to the face, becauſe he was to be blamed; for before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles; but when they were come, he withdrew, and ſeparated himſelf, fearing them which were of the circumciſion: and the other Jews diſſembled likewiſe with him,</hi>
